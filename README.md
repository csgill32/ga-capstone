DESCRIPTION:
I love cooking, and often get my inspiration from online recipes. However, I almost ALWAYS end up changing the recipe somehow. A little more of this, a little less of that, substitute this, completely get rid of that. And when I finish a meal that I'm particularly proud of, what do I do? Pin the recipe on Pinterest, create a bookmark on my browser, or take a screenshot. So when the time comes that I decide to whip up that tasty meal I made two months ago, I have no recollection of any changes or substitutions I made the first time. Thus, RecipeBook was born! An incredibly user-friendly app to store all of your recipes in one place, and easily update them over time. No more disappointing meals because it didn't taste as good as the first time!
