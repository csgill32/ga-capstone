# ga-capstone

Idea: Site for people to create and store recipes

A user can:
- Register for an account and sign in to view their personal recipes
- Create recipes by inputting directions and ingredients
- Edit recipes/ingredients
- Delete recipes/ingredients
- Copy one version of a recipe to create a new version
- Search for recipes by title and ingredient name

Stretch ideas:
- Sort recipes into various categories 
- Print-friendly version
- Upload pictures of steps and/or final product
- Prev/next recipe page (like a book)

Technology:
- Backend: Node & Express
- Frontend: React
- Sass?
